    <h3>(?) Why I don't list my Education here?</h3>
    <p>I believe that anyone can qualify for a job as long as they study and practice their craft passionately. Despite having no background in design, I became a designer because I love to draw and experiment with different creative ideas. Currently, I am striving to become a full-stack designer since I aim to expand my skill set and keep learning.</p>
